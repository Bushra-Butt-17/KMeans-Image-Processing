Welcome to **KMeans-Image-Processing**, a Python-based project that applies the **K-Means clustering algorithm** to perform **color quantization** and **image segmentation**. By experimenting with various values of **k** (e.g., 3, 10, 20), this project demonstrates how clustering impacts the visual quality of images. This tool is ideal for exploring the power of unsupervised learning in image processing and achieving efficient image compression.

## **Description** üí°  

This project focuses on implementing the **K-Means clustering algorithm** for **image processing** tasks such as:  

- **Color Quantization**: Reducing the number of colors in an image.  
- **Image Segmentation**: Grouping pixels based on color similarity.  

It showcases how changing the number of clusters (**k**) impacts the results. You can explore the effects of clustering with different values of **k** on sample images to understand the trade-offs between compression and image fidelity.

## **Features** üåü  

- **K-Means Clustering** for image color quantization and segmentation.  
- Comparison of results with varying cluster sizes (`k = 3, 10, 20`).  
- Visual demonstrations of original vs. processed images for easy understanding.  
- Supports a variety of images for experimentation.

## **Technologies Used** üõ†Ô∏è  

The following technologies and libraries were used in this project:  

- **Python 3.x**: The programming language used for the project.  
- **NumPy**: For efficient numerical operations on arrays.  
- **OpenCV**: For image loading and preprocessing.  
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing the clustering results.  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For running and displaying the project in an interactive environment.

## **Dataset and Visualization** üñºÔ∏è  

### **Included Images**  
Two images included in the repository showcase the effects of K-Means clustering:  

1. **grid_kmean.png**  
   Displays a grid of clustering results applied to multiple images, demonstrating how varying **k** values (3, 10, 20) affect image appearance.  

   ![Grid of K-Means Clustering](images/grid_kmean.png)  

2. **parrots(random).png**  
   Displays clustering on a sample image of parrots with random **k** values (e.g., 2, 10, 20), showing how clustering impacts image segmentation.

### **Visualization Example**  
Each processed image is compared side-by-side with its original version, enabling a clear understanding of the clustering effect.

## **How It Works** üîç  

The **K-Means Clustering** algorithm is applied to images in the following steps:  

1. **Input Preprocessing**:  
   - Images are loaded using OpenCV and reshaped into a 2D array.  
   - Each row represents a pixel, and columns represent the RGB color channels.  

2. **Centroid Initialization**:  
   - Random centroids are selected from the pixel data points.  

3. **Clustering**:  
   - For each iteration, pixels are assigned to the nearest centroid based on **Manhattan Distance**.  
   - Centroids are updated to minimize the sum of squared distances (SSD).  

4. **Reconstruction**:  
   - Pixels are replaced with their assigned centroid values.  
   - The reconstructed image is displayed.  

5. **Comparison**:  
   - Results are visualized for different values of **k** (e.g., 3, 10, 20), highlighting the trade-off between simplicity and detail.
