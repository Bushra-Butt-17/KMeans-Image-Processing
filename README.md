# KMeans-Image-Processing
This repository implements the K-Means clustering algorithm for image color quantization. It demonstrates how K-Means can be applied to reduce the number of colors in an image, making it a powerful technique for image compression and feature extraction. The project supports multiple images and visualizes the results for various values of k.
